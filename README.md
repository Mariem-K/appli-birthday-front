# appli-birthday-front

Appli Birthday is a project developed during my apprenticeship at O'Clock with fellow classmates. Appli Birthday is meant to keep track of birthday dates and other important events. 

We were a team of four: two in the frontend team, and two in the backend team. I was part of the frontend team. The frontend team used Flutter and Dart to develop the application.
